Below link is to buy a copy of CrossOver from their official website and help me in the process

<a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/store?ad=1009">Buy CrossOver from this link to support me </a>

Until October 17, 2023, clicking on the above link and entering GAMEMODE23 as deal code at the payment screen, you’ll be getting a 23% discount. 

This is to celebrate CrossOver 23.5 release, which is available for MacOS Sonoma.


As I explain in my videos, very few plugins are not rendering the UI with CrossOver 23. 

But the same license can be used for CrossOver 22, which is what I suggest to use from Mojave to Ventura.

(CrossOver 22 should not work on Sonoma).

AudioGridder and CrossGridder versions are not dependent and I do not develop AG, it's developed by Andreas Pohl/e47.

CrossGridder 1.5 IS OUT!!! 

Subscribe to my YouTube channel and send an email to crossgridder@gmail.com to get it.

It has AudioGridderServer.exe 1.2.0 stable release installed.

There are few updates: Most plugins previously not working now are.

Another one is that it is ready to have Akaizer.exe working through it.

Support for Linux is on Hiatus. Support for High Sierra is over. I will still provide CG_HS to subscribers requesting for it.

Stay tuned!

Q: What is CrossGridder 1.5?

A: CROSSGRIDDER is a bottle for CrossOver 20, 21 and 22 containing AudioGridderServer.exe 1.2.0 Stable release.

However, if your OS supports it, CrossOver 22 is strongly suggested.

CROSSGRIDDER lets you use Windows-only VSTs on macOS much like they were natives plugins.
